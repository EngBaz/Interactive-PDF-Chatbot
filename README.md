# Interactive PDF Chatbot with LangGraph, FAISS, Groq Llama 3 and Streamlit

This project presents an example of a Q&A assistant using LangChain, Groq Llama 3, FAISS vectorstore, and Streamlit.
The assistant can handle conversational context and assist in answering questions related to an uploaded document.

## Introduction
The project showcases the implementation of a custom question-answering RAG system that leverages LangGraph, an open-source framework, to interact with users in a conversational manner. The assistant answers questions related to a specific uploaded document and uses advanced RAG techniques such as corrective-RAG.

## Setup

To setup this project on your local machine, follow the below steps:
1. Clone this repository: <code>git clone github.com/EngBaz/Hybrid-RAG-System</code>

2. Create a virtual enviromnent
   ```console
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies by running <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

4. Obtain an API key from OpenAI, Cohere AI and Groq. Store the APIs in a <code>.env</code> file as follows:
    ```console
    
    $ OPENAI_API_KEY="your api key"
    $ GROQ_API_KEY="your api key"
    $ COHERE_API_KEY="your api key"
    ```

## Usage

To use the conversational agent:
1. In the terminal, run the streamlit app: <code> streamlit run main.py </code>
2. Select the appropriate format of your file 
3. Upload your file
4. Write a specific question about the uploaded file
5. The agent will process the input and respond with relevant information
